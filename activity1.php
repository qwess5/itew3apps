<div class="one">
It's you, it's always you<br>
If I'm ever gonna fall in love I know it's gon' be you<br>
It's you, it's always you<br>
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you<br>
<br>
<br>
So, please, don't break my heart<br>
Don't tear me apart<br>
I know how it starts<br>
Trust me, I've been broken before<br>
Don't break me again<br>
I am delicate<br>
Please, don't break my heart<br>
Trust me, I've been broken before<br>
<br>
<br>
I've been broken, yeah<br>
I know how it feels<br>
To be open<br>
And then find out your love isn't real<br>
I'm still hurting, yeah<br>
I'm hurting inside<br>
I'm so scared to fall in love<br>
But if it's you then I'll try<br>
<br>
<br>
It's you, it's always you<br>
If I'm ever gonna fall in love I know it's gon' be you<br>
It's you, it's always you<br>
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you<br>

Please, don't break my heart<br>
Trust me, I've been broken before<br>
<br>
<br>
I know I'm not the best at choosing lovers<br>
We both know my past speaks for itself<br>
(For itself)<br>
If you don't think that we're right for each other (Baby, no)<br>
Then, please, don't let history repeat itself<br>
<br>
<br>
'Cause I want you (yeah, yeah), I want you (yeah, yeah)<br>
There's nothing else I want
'Cause I want you (yeah, yeah), I want you (yeah, yeah)<br>
And you're the only thing I want<br>
It's you, it's always you<br>
If I'm ever gonna fall in love I know it's gon' be you<br>
It's you, it's always you<br>
